        "description": "Explore the transcendent world of unity and ultimate beauty in Edgar Allan Poe's verse in this complete poetry collection.\n        Although best known for his short stories, Edgar Allan Poe was by nature and choice a poet. From his exquisite lyric \"To Helen,\"\n        to his immortal masterpieces, \"Annabel Lee,\" \"The Bells,\" and \"The Raven,\" Poe stands beside the celebrated English romantic poets Shelley,\n        Byron, and Keats, and his haunting, sensuous poetic vision profoundly influenced the Victorian giants Swinburne, Tennyson, and Rossetti.\n        Today his dark side speaks eloquently to contemporary readers in poems such as \"The Haunted Palace\" and \"The Conqueror Worm,\" with their\n        powerful images of madness and the macabre. But even at the end of his life, Poe reached out to his art for comfort and courage,\n        giving us in \"Eldorado\" a talisman to hold during our darkest moments--a timeless gift from a great American writer.",

His job is \n      to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce,\n      returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television 'family.' But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him\n      to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. When Mildred attempts\n      suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the\n      fireman has to run for his life.",

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands\n      of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.\n      Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem,\n      and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever. Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone--a structure only as strong as those\n      guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond,\n      in the land of the creatures of ice. From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers,\n      nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness,\n      the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.",
